Two friends lived in a black cottage
One of them was Sage
Other was Crist
Both of them were brilliant scientist

They had an army of sparrows
Which shot laser nor too wide nor too narrow
And highly skilled detective octopus
Who lived on blood from the enemy he sucks

Their ambition was to dominate the world
For which they can get the powers from an emerald
Sage found how to travel with the speed of light
And Crist sighted a planet which was pearly white

They wnet on the journey for the planet
In their spaceship which they called Sanit
Above the constellations and around the starts
With the planet's inhabitants they had a great war

All the sparrows were dead
And the octopus was bleeding red
They wanted to save their lives
So the targeted for the earth and dived

But when they reached the earth they were in a great shock
For it was destroyed and when they saw their clocks
They were ahead thousands years in the future
This was nothing but humour!
